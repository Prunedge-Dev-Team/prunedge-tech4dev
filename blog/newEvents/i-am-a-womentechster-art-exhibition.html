              The launch of the #IAMAWOMANTECHSTER campaign through the #IAMAWOMANTECHSTER Art Exhibition was such a success. The #IAMAWOMANTECHSTER Campaign is geared towards celebrating women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields in general and inspiring more women to consider the endless possibilities available to them within the technology ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the art exhibition, we received 43 art entries, 16 finalists were selected, and three winners were chosen by a panel of judges: Baba Agba, Temitayo Aina, Nguher Zaki, Benita Nnachortam, Adebayo Akande, and Olumbe Akinkugbe. The finalists were Bright Charles, Anjolaoluwa Olanrewaju, Oluwapelumi Oluyemi, Zainab Asafa, Ifeoluwa Aminu, Mariam Olubunmi Aliyu, Ogunmadeko Olamide Ayobami, Akinola Taoheed Olaitan, Taiwo Aina, Nwamaka Akah, Nwafor Ifeoma Blessing, and Enifo Agodo.  
            </p>
            <p>
               Each finalist went home with consolation prizes, and we sold out 12 of the 16 artworks put up for exhibition. All proceeds from the artwork would be remitted to the artists because we are a non-profit organization. The art exhibition winners announced by the judges were Yewande Ambeke, Ifeoluwa Aminu, and Jessica Louis, and we handsomely rewarded them with Five Hundred Dollars cash gifts each. The cheques were presented to them by Orimolade Oluwamuyemi A., Philanthropies Lead, Nigeria and Ghana, Microsoft, Daniel Ale, Partner & Chief Technology Officer at Prunedge, Deji Adejuyigbe, Senior Sales Executive | CitiColors Design & Prints Limited.

               There was lots of food and drinks to go round with top-notch music, and it was just the perfect networking setting. One of the Finalists, Nwamaka Akah, was also a Women Techster Beneficiary, and it was beautiful to see her excelling all around. It further strengthened our belief that the female gender has no niche and can excellently exist wherever they find themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
               In attendance were art lovers from different spheres of life, press people, and art curators. The #IAMWOMANTECHSTER art exhibition will be a yearly campaign advocating for gender inclusion within the technology ecosystem. We are hopeful that next year will be even bigger. You can follow all conversations around the campaign using the #IAmAWomanTechster hashtag.
