                All around the world, February is known as the month of love. In commemoration of this, Tech4Dev, in partnership with our technology partner, Prunedge, carries out the Love Act every year. The Love Act was born out of a need to show love to the people in our immediate community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thirteen teams were coiled out from Tech4Dev and Prunedge in Lagos, Abuja, and Akure. Each team was made up of at least ten people and was tasked with showing love to specific groups of people according to their discretion. The organizations disbursed a standard amount of fifty thousand naira to each group for them to successfully carry out their various projects.
