            My name is Ayooluwa Olufunmilayo Balogun, a graduate of Biochemistry from the University of Lagos. I am currently a beneficiary of the Digital Skills for Employability (DSFE) training. The Digital Skills for Employability is a program designed by Microsoft to build the capacity of youth to compete favorably in the labor markets
        </p>
        <p>
            The initiative focuses on providing access to digital skills training for young people in Nigeria between the ages of 16-35 years in one of these five learning tracks Cybersecurity, Data Science and Visualisation, Product Design, Product Management, and Software Development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I heard about the DSFE training on LinkedIn and applied for the Data Science & Visualisation learning track. Before the DSFE training, I had very little knowledge of digital skills. I just knew the terminologies and how to navigate the basics. But, during the DSFE training, I learnt how to use some data analysis tools and visualization tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am thankful for the DSFE program because I have a better understanding of Data Science and AI and am more convinced that it is the career I want to tow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I think some areas can be worked on to make the training better than it already is, I generally enjoyed the DSFE training. I would easily recommend it to anyone looking to learn digital skills.
