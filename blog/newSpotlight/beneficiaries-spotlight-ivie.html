            My name is Emwiongbon Ivie, a beneficiary of the Women Techsters Fellowship. I studied computer science in school, and while in school, I have always loved the idea of becoming a programmer and building applications that work on both mobile and the web. I saw how these innovations changed the world, and I wanted to be part of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately for me, after my stay in school, I came across the Women techster virtual program through a friend who shared the flyer and encouraged me to apply. I applied, and after a selection process, I got selected as a beneficiary under the Web and Mobile Development learning track.
        </p>
        <p>
            While applying, I had a lot of expectations, one of which was gaining well-grounded knowledge in web development and software development as a whole. I am glad to say that I gained all the knowledge needed to kickstart my journey and career in programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a while, I got a job at Reliance Infosystem. I can boldly say that my training at the Women Techsters was instrumental in helping me secure this job because it shaped my knowledge in programming as I had minimal experience as I applied for the training.
        </p>
        <p>
            My experience with Women Techsters was a great and enjoyable one. The teaching format was very well detailed, and the instructor was attentive to everyoneâ€™s learning process and comprehension ability.
        </p>
        <p>
            My advice to young ladies looking to go into tech would be to take advantage of any Women Techsters programs and put great effort into learning and practicing. I would also advise them to prioritize having a healthy learning relationship with other women who aspire to get into tech, as networking is helpful in career growth.
