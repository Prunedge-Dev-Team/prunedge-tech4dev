        <p>
            My name is Yazid Salahaludeen Mikail. I hail from Kaduna State, and I am a 3rd-year chemical engineering student at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. I heard about Tech4Dev from social media. I saw a call for application for community facilitators in 2020 and applied. I volunteered with Tech4Dev because I love volunteering with causes that align with my core values as a social development worker and enthusiast.
        </p>
        <p>
            I volunteered with Tech4Dev as a Project Manager in Kaduna State, and my experience was fantastic. It was a learning period for me as it allowed me to practice my leadership skills. It was also my first hands-on practical experience. I got this opportunity just after completing the capstone project I worked on when taking a project management professional course.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a volunteer, I led a team of 5 facilitators to implementing an all-inclusive seven-week Digital Literacy Program tagged "Digital Tribe" Funded by UKaid and implemented by Tech4Dev in collaboration with Kaduna_ICTHub that equipped 181 women, girls, PWDs, and vulnerable populations with digital skills in Kaduna.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project aimed to bridge the digital gap in underserved communities. Some of the beneficiaries of this project are working, while some started a career using the digital skills they acquired during the training. It constantly excites me to know that I was part of something this huge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Volunteering with Tech4Dev has impacted you or your career in such a good way. It was the first project I managed professionally, and the experience opened the door for some projects I have had the opportunity to manage now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I always encourage people to be open to volunteering because volunteering provides the perfect enabling environment that helps people discover purpose and become the best versions of themselves. I would easily recommend volunteering with Tech4Dev to anyone looking for an opportunity to impact the social and developmental space.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tech4Dev is an organization known for its integrity and impact. Suppose in the future. I have the opportunity to volunteer with them again. In that case, I will be open to offering professional advice on community engagement, project management, and data analysis if need be.
