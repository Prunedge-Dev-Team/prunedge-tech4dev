                    What is your background (profession/ workplace/ training)?
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Arinze Odika. I am a 300 level student of Accountancy at the Imo State University Owerri. I
                    volunteer as a local programs manager for the NWTImo program.

                    What inspired you to become a Tech4Dev volunteer?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was introduced to empowerment, technology, and volunteering through my mentor Hon Meekam Mgbewelu, who is
                    a Tech4dev partner. Working with him and other volunteers have made me see how people's lives have been
                    improved. This is what inspires me to keep on volunteering. I'm a huge advocate for people empowerment.

                    What do you do as a Volunteer at Tech4Dev?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a project manager. I help ensure that the training and program run optimally and without hitches.

                    Please share one of your favorite Tech4Dev sessions or moments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was delighted to have the wife of the Governor recommend our efforts as volunteers for the Imo program.
                    Also being able to help the trainees whenever they have issues is something I look forward to.
                </p>
                <p class="sub-heading">
                    What do you gain from volunteering?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have gained lots of experience in people management, communication, and exposure to new situations and
                    people. The experience has been fulfilling. I'm a huge advocate for people empowerment. I am a volunteer for
                    this initiative because it empowers women to be skilled: both as job seekers and job creators.

                    Why is it essential for one to volunteer?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Volunteering helps one to gather skills and experiences that can be relevant in handling challenges from
                    jobs. It's also a good pointer for potential employers.
                </p>

                    What tips do you have for new volunteers?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always try to be of help, offering a helping hand to trainees in need of assistance can go a long way in
                    motivating trainees.
