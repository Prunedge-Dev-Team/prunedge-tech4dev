            </i>
            <p>
               Building on its quest to build a diverse and inclusive team, Sterling Bank has signed a Memorandum
               of Understanding with Technology for Social Change and Development Initiative (Tech4Dev), a
               non-profit social enterprise working to provide access to decent work for Africans through digital
               and technology skills empowerment and advocacy.
            </p>
            <p>
               At the signing ceremony held recently at the Marina Headquarters of the financial institution in
               Lagos, Sterling Bank officially committed to partner with the Tech4Dev as an experiential learning
               partner for its Women Techsters initiative. The Women Techsters is an initiative of Tech4Dev aimed
               at bridging the digital divide between men and women in the technology ecosystem by
               empowering 5 million women across Africa with digital and deep tech skills by 2030. The
               organization is currently in partnership with Microsoft to empower 10,000 women in 2021 across
               five African countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt.
            </p>        
            <p>
               Speaking at the signing, Tech4Dev’s Co-Founder and Executive Director, Oladiwura Oladepo
               reiterated the importance of the partnership with Sterling Bank. In her words, <i>“Gender equality is
               at the heart of what we do at Tech4Dev and is a huge part of our Women Techsters initiative. We
                are delighted about forward-thinking organizations like Sterling Bank, who are thinking of what the
                workforce will look like in the next two, three, five years and the importance of gender balance
               within the ecosystem. At the end of the internship period, we want Sterling Bank to be able to say
               they got value from the interns.”</i>
            </p>
            <p>
               In the same vein, Olayinka Oni, Chief Digital Officer at Sterling Bank spoke on the company’s
               desire to build a diverse team, <i>“Diversity is not a compliance agenda, it is an intentional strategy.
               Internship for us is also intentional. We are interested in any project that grows the ecosystem like
               the Women Techsters initiative”</i>
            </p>
            <p>
               Some of the Women Techsters Fellows across the 5 countries on the continent are presently in the
               final week of their intensive training, and will be direct beneficiaries of this partnership with Sterling
               Bank on a 6-month internship period with the company. 
            </p>
            <p>
