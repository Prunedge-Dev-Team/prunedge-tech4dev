               To achieve her goal of impacting 10,000 women in 2021 and 5 million women across Africa by 2030 through the Women Techsters initiative, Tech4Dev - a non-profit social enterprise working to provide access to decent work for Africans through digital and technology skills empowerment and advocacy- launched the #IAmAWomanTechster Campaign with an Art Exhibition on Sunday, 12th of September 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
               The Women Techsters Initiative is an initiative of Tech4Dev in partnership with Microsoft aimed at bridging the digital divide between men and women in the technology ecosystem by empowering 5 million women across Africa with digital and deep tech skills by 2030. The initiative is currently being delivered across five African countries; Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Egypt to reach 10,000 women by the end of 2021.
            </p>        
            <p>
               The #IAmAWomanTechster Campaign was born out of the need to advocate for and inspire more women to consider technology careers, while celebrating women who have built careers in these fields, to serve as a model for other women and possibly provide guidance to the next crop of women through their career journeys.
            </p>
            <p>
               To launch the campaign, Tech4Dev called for visual artists to share artworks celebrating women and women in technology and STEM fields. Out of 43 entries submitted, 16 finalists were chosen, with 3 of them - Ifeoluwa Aminu, Yewande Ambeke and Jessica Ogechi Louis - emerging as winners of the competition to go home with $500 each.

               Speaking at the Art Exhibition and Campaign launch event, Joel Ogunsola, the Director of Partnerships and Sustainability at Tech4Dev, highlighted the aim and objectives of the campaign. He said, <i>“As an organization that is passionate about bridging the digital divide between men and women in the technology ecosystem, we decided the best way to launch the #IAmAWomanTechster campaign was by celebrating Women in tech and STEM fields using various art forms to showcase and support women in STEM fields and within the technology ecosystem because representation matters. We are big on empowering young people, and as a result, all proceeds from the artworks sold will be remitted to the artists and all winners will receive their winnings.”</i>
            </p>
            <p>
               The I Am a Woman Techster Campaign will be a yearly campaign advocating for gender inclusion within the technology ecosystem. All conversations around the campaign can be followed using the #IAmAWomanTechster hashtag.
