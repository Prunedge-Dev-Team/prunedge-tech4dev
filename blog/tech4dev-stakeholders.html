            In a time of social distancing and government-enforced lockdowns to curtail the spread of COVID-19, digital technology has enabled the continuation of work, 
            education, and communication. But for millions of people who are unable to use technology, being offline is economically and socially isolating. COVID-19 has 
            further illuminated the 'digital divide', which is even more pronounced in Nigeria (worse in poor rural clusters of Northern Nigeria). Therefore, it has become 
            pertinent, especially on this path to the new normal for focus to be on digital literacy, to capacitate vulnerable populations to leverage technology for commerce, 
            education, and communication to improve their socio-economic recovery and pandemic resilience and build a more prosperous future.
        </p>
        <p>
           This and many more were the highlights of the Stakeholders' Engagement Forum organised by Technology for Social Change and Development Initiative (Tech4Dev), a non-profit 
           organisation established to empower African communities with digital skills to bridge the gap of unskilled labour needed for the future of work. This Forum served as part 
           of activities to end weeks of training on the Basic Digital Literacy for Rural Clusters in Northern Nigeria, a project funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development 
           Office (FCDO). A total of 1,338 beneficiaries were empowered with basic digital literacy; of which over 600 were girls/women and 400+ were Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), 
           across ten states in Northern Nigeria where this program took place, namely; Zamfara, Kaduna, Kwara, Kogi, Benue, Sokoto, Jigawa, Nasarawa, Niger and Plateau states. 
           In her opening remarks, The Head of Prosperity Fund Nigeria, Martha Bostock, was delighted on the program's progress and the impact the initiative was able to make, especially 
           the focus being on vulnerable women and girls, Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) and other vulnerable groups. She said, "The UK Government is committed to supporting the 
           advancement of the use of technology in Nigeria through various programs it is implementing with partners." She also emphasised how technology has created opportunities 
           and leverage for vulnerable groups especially considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

           As part of positioning itself as a thought leader in empowering African communities with digital skills, Tech4Dev also used the opportunity of the Stakeholders' Engagement 
           Forum to launch a Handbook and Factsheet, which is an offshoot of the just-completed Basic Digital Literacy for Rural Clusters in Northern Nigeria to highlight insights and 
           learnings from the Programme. They encourage other like-minded organisations in the skills development space to deploy as a framework for such initiatives in the country and 
           Africa at large. The Handbook and Factsheet were launched by the Honourable Minister of State, Budget and National Planning, Prince Clement Agba. He reiterated the importance 
           of partnerships that drive towards ensuring the availability of opportunities for underserved communities and positively impacts the quality of human capital within the country.

        <p>
           Speaking during the presentation of key learnings and challenges from the Factsheet, Diwura Oladepo, Executive Director at Tech4Dev, reiterated that <i>"our focus is to get as many 
           Nigerians, especially in the rural areas, to become digitally literate. The world is fast-moving, and we must move with it. There are indeed many gaps that affect our work, but we 
           must work with what we have to achieve the results we want. Support from Government and community stakeholders has helped to amplify impact, and we believe the lessons learnt will 
           inform the scalability of our efforts."</i>
        </p>
        <p>
           The forum had representatives from the host state governments and supporting stakeholders that facilitated the implementation of the Programme and beneficiary groups and key 
           stakeholders from the Federal Government of Nigeria in attendance.
