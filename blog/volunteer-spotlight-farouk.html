                    What is your background (profession/ workplace/ training)?
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Farouq Umar. I'm a writer, content developer, system analyst, program, and project manager.  I also work as the Programs Manager at Startup Kano Hub.

                    What inspired you to become a Tech4Dev volunteer?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can say the spirit of willingness and the passion towards building my nation. I have always had a passion for giving back to my community. Volunteering for Tech4Dev gave me that position and opportunity. I believe giving back is very important as it helps one to grow. My Passion for building humanity motivated me to become a volunteer at Tech4dev.

                    What do you do as a Volunteer at Tech4Dev?
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work is exciting. As the Local Programs Manager, I facilitate and coordinate the NWT training, here in Kano. It's been a very impactful time for me. I have been able to brush up my project management skills, and also meet new people while ensuring the training sessions are productive.

                    Please share one of your favourite Tech4Dev sessions or moments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is my first time coordinating a Tech4dev program, so I can say this is my best moments as Tech4dev volunteer. I was amazed seeing people who were novices to the tech, become champions in the space of a few weeks. I especially like the project presentation i.e the demo day. It was my best session.

                    What do you gain from volunteering?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well... if you are alive, you will always learn. However, I gain new experiences.

                    Why is it essential for one to volunteer?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wow, it's an adventure of its own; with a different story, which comes with its advantage and opportunity as well as experience.

                    What tips do you have for new volunteers?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Volunteer for the sake of promoting what you believe in. Never be discouraged by whatever will come in the line of the volunteering course. Also, be dedicated and be on point at what you are doing. I guess these should be all that I can say.
