                When I walked into the Wema Bank headquarters building in Marina Lagos, I couldn’t have imagined how my day would go. It was a day I got to meet firsthand some of the most innovative, forward-thinking women in tech.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the interview was scheduled for 10 am, the traffic I faced on my way to the Island already knocked the wind off my sail. However, my consolation was that I would do what I love to do, talk to people. Thank God we didn’t have to walk the stairs to the 12th floor with our camera equipment.
            </p>        
            <p>
                So, we’re in the building. My job on the day was simple: interview at least six Women Techsters fellows to get testimonials for our social media page and their line managers to talk to us frankly about their performance during their internship period.
            </p>
            <p>
                We set up the cameras and took some pictures. I had my seat and said, ‘hello, my name is Kelvin. Please, introduce yourself and your position at Wema Bank.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first person I interviewed was Dorcas Oluwafisola, a product designer. She worked on some fantastic visuals we all saw when Wema Bank celebrated ALAT at 5—not going to leak everything she said here. You’ll see the video for yourself soon on our social media pages. At first, she was shy, but when she got comfortable, she couldn’t stop talking, and I enjoyed our conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also had an exciting discussion with Abayomi Adeola, popularly called ‘Della,’ a graduate of the Project Management learning track from the Women Techsters Fellowship who transitioned to tech from ‘law.’ Since changing her career focus, she hasn’t looked back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the comments made by the Women Techsters Fellows during our conversations, and interviews with them were:
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>“The Women Techsters Fellowship came at the right time in my life when I needed direction. I transitioned to tech from law, and I think tech has been what I have wanted to do for a long time."</i>"
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>“The experience during the fellowship was exciting and is the foundation of the skills I have today. My internship at Wema Bank has been rewarding. I have been able to take on so many projects, and from the first minute I walked into this place, no one treated me as an intern."</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>“All I see from here is growth and I can only thank Tech4Dev for the impact they’ve had in my life and I’m excited more girls are getting the opportunity to go into tech.”</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Their line managers were full of accolades for them.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>
                    “I can tell you that I have written to management to give most of them an offer, and I can tell you that I can’t wait to get new interns from the project,” 
                </i>
                Head, Innovation - ALAT by Wema, Mr. Solomon Ayodele, said.
            </p>
            <p>
                In total, I interacted with six Women Techsters fellows and have been wowed out of my mind. I can’t wait to see what the thousands that have made it out of the program will do.
            </p>
            <p>
                And you say tech is for men! Watch out, world! The Women Techsters fellows are here to take over.
