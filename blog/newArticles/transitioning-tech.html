                Recently, there has been an uproar about the relevance of learning a tech skill, especially for those looking at attaining financial freedom. If you belong to this category, the very first thing I would like you to know is: that you do not precisely need background knowledge in science to transition into tech. Of course, there are many career paths in tech that require you to have a science background to thrive in those career paths. But the good thing is that there are still a lot of career paths in tech that don't require you to be a graduate of science for you to thrive in the tech world. Whether you are currently in Law, Banking, Finance, or even Medicine, it is possible to make a seamless career transition into technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                As impressive as it is to become a tech-bro or a tech sis earning in dollars and having flexible working hours, it is essential to note that pursuing a career in technology can be challenging. This is not to discourage you from transitioning and chasing your dreams, but it is to prepare for the challenges that pursuing a career path would most likely bring your way.
            </p>        
            <p>
                Here are some other things you need to know or do while transitioning into tech
            </p>
             <Ol>
              
                <li>
                    <strong class="bold_text">Weigh your options carefully:</strong>
                    The tech space is vast, so there are over a dozen career paths in tech. These roles range from technical positions requiring coding to roles like Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Web Developer, Database Administrator, Data analysis, etc., to career paths that do not require coding like Product Manager, Product Owner, Project manager, Product design, etc.  
               </li>
                <li>
                    <b class="bold_text">Understand what role you want to play in the tech space:</b> 
                    Take time to study yourself and understand your kind of person. This would play a vital role in helping you decide what career path in tech you are willing to tread. This decision can either be influenced by your personality or even your career background. For example, if you naturally love to solve problems or create solutions to existing problems, you should consider "Product Management" as a career path. If you are an individual in the HR Space may naturally want to go for Agile HR Analytics, just like a graduate of Engineering might want to consider pursuing a career path in Software Development. One thing that can play a huge role in transitioning is knowing where you can easily fit in.
               </li>
                <li>
                    <b class="bold_text">Invest in learning:</b> 
                    There is no fast route to succeeding in any tech-related field as it requires consistency, dedication, doggedness, time, effort, discipline, and hard work. Learning never stops, so it is important to continually and consciously give yourself to knowledge. Amazingly, you can find relevant and insightful resources to kickstart your career in tech for free, and organizations that offer digital skills training.
                    <br>
                    Tech4Dev is one of the organizations that provide training in tech skills, and the good thing is, all their trainings are free. As an organization, they run many programs that can help you kickstart your journey. Another good thing about being a participant in any of these programs is that you are taught these skills and will be offered further support to help you grow and stay relevant.
               </li>
                <li>
                    <b class="bold_text">Practice the skill(s) learned:</b> 
                     One common mistake that most people make after they acquire a skill is to do nothing to groom the skills after learning. After learning, you must go ahead to groom the skills acquired by trying out your hands on real-life projects and practical experiences, and also applying for internships or even volunteering.
               </li>
                <li>
                    <b class="bold_text">Flexibility:</b>
                    The tech space is constantly evolving. To survive in the tech world, you need to be flexible, and every ready to learn, unlearn, and relearn. You need to be able catch up and stay up-to-date with relevant trends in the tech industry and adjust as swiftly as possible.

               </li>
               <li>
                    <b class="bold_text">Stay Consistent:</b>
                    Every good thing takes time. Transitioning into tech should not be seen as a get-rich-quick scheme because it requires you putting in time, effort, and much more into building a career in tech. If, by any chance, you are looking at transitioning into tech because you are looking for quick money, you might have to reconsider your options. Of course, there is indeed a lot of money in the tech industry, but it requires that you consistently put in the work to achieve the desired result of living a life of financial freedom.

               </li>
                  <li>
                    <b class="bold_text">Networking:</b>  
                    After acquiring a tech skill, it is essential to find an active community to join. Beyond support, a good community would bring opportunities your way, and make it easy for you to be in sync with the happenings in the industry. Another advantage of enrolling in any Tech4Dev programs is, you won't be on your own after as you would have the opportunity to join an active network of fellow participants/graduates. You will make meaningful connections and immediately become a part of the ever-growing tech community.   
                    Transitioning into a career in tech is not impossible, and yes, you can get into tech with zero experience. Also, there are more ways to do it than you probably think, but then you need to start, just start.
