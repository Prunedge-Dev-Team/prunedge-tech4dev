                World Food Day is an annually celebrated event. It is usually marked across 150 countries on October 16th, the same day the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) was founded. The theme of this year's World Food Day is Our actions are our future. Better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life
            </p>
            <p>
                This theme emphasizes the importance of conscious and consistent efforts, which makes achieving major feats and impacts possible. One of the conscious efforts that we can make to achieve better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life is to infuse technology into the processes by building technology around it, seeing that the world is advancing fast towards becoming a digital village. This is why at Tech4Dev we are committed to equipping Africans with digital skills and life skills that foster economic prosperity, financial freedom, and sustainable development.

                In the recently concluded Women Techsters Career Week, one of the groups that presented during the demo proposed a security system for fish farmers. They called it Smart System fish farmers. They built this using Tableau, Microsoft Excel, Figma, Kaggle, and other tools, which they learned the use of during the training at the Women Techsters Fellowship, which lasted four months. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This system was designed to help fish farmers monitor activities on their farms without them being physically present. It does this by building a surveillance system around the fish farm using a camera and sensors. Aside from this project, other groups presented awe-inspiring projects, which reminded us of the importance of our work at Tech4Dev.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, during the Women Techsters Bootcamp held earlier this year about three groups also worked on and presented impressive food projects during their Demo Day. In the coming years, we are dedicated to equipping even more people with digital skills, and we are hopeful that these skills, systems, and processes will be built towards a better life.
