                Congratulations! You made it despite the hurdles of the application to the Nigerian Women Techsters, from the application to the video submission to the assessment to the interview, and now, you're in! If you didn't make it, I still have something for you, so still read through.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that you have made it, it's not the end of the road. Some things are still critical as you go on this journey. It's not going to be all rosy, but you can prepare your mind for the best and see yourself finishing the program before you start.
            </p>        
            <p>
                As I mentioned to some of you, the fellowship is intense and valuable; you must learn to make the most out of it. Whether you're a student, a professional, or you run a 9-5, making plans for your time in the fellowship would go a long way.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an Alumna of the Women Techsters Fellowship, here are some things you should know based on my experience. Our classes were 4 hours daily, and we had weekly assignments and projects. During the fellowship, I was still a final year student having lectures and doing so many things in between, and I took a lot of sacrificial moves that made it possible for me to thrive in the fellowship despite the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I wrote my final exams in school, we still had classes at WTF, and I remember having to attend classes even on days I had a noon exam. I would attend class till 11, excuse myself for my exam, and catch up when I'm back. This happened multiple times.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what can you do to have a good Fellowship experience?
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Understand what you're aiming for: Career progression? Long-term project? Experience? Or just trying your hands on something? Whatever your aim, it would reflect your participation during the fellowship. Because of how tedious it is, you want to hold on to something greater than just trying to do another course.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plan your time well: The Women Techsters Fellowship would require you to sit in live classes from 9-1 pm WAT. You may have to miss your school work, excuse yourself from work, get a remote job and clear your calendar for the time. It would save you a lot. I missed all my classes during those times, and when it was pressing, I took permission from my Facilitator.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Accountability: Have a community of ladies in the program to whom you can be accountable. There were times a couple of us almost gave up on the fellowship, but every time they told us, we'd encourage each other and move again. The truth is, you'd have a lot of valid reasons to give up, but it's not advisable. Always remember number 1.

                    Be open to learning: One of the things that helped me get better and available to something I knew almost nothing about was that I was open to learning and asking questions in classes. Thanks to Margaret, who was the Facilitator for my learning track. She was very patient and could repeatedly go back on a thing to make you understand. The same was said about facilitators in the different tracks.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I hope you find these tips helpful. Please share with someone you know would need it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you didn't get in, a good step would be to follow Nigerian Women Techsters and apply for the next Bootcamp, attend open days, and set yourself up for another successful application next year. With the Bootcamp alone, you're set for a fantastic start, and you can continue to learn on your own with courses, get the notes of those who got in, and don't rest on your oars. Get Mentorship and never stop learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know people who didn't get in last year but got in this year. It just always gets better. I'm hopeful for you the best.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, congratulations!
