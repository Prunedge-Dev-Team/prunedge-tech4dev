                Over time, the tech sector has grown to be one of the most rewarding sectors globally. Here are some statistics to back up this claim. According to Goremotely, The US tech industry market is worth around $1.6 trillion, and the tech industry is expected to reach a $5 trillion market value by the end of 2021.

                Going by this, we can say that Tech has become one of the most desirable career paths. Those who work in the tech space are addressed as Tech bros and are recognized as part of the high-earning labour force. All around, people associate Tech with the future of work because of its constant dynamic and appreciating nature. Hence, daily, more and more people are motivated to go into Tech. However, Tech is a very vast sector, and so, soon enough, people are stuck on what part of Tech to pursue and how to go about it

            <p>
                Hence, this article is a step-by-step guide on getting into the tech space.

                <li>
                    <b class="bold_text">Stay in your zone:</b> The beauty of Tech being vast is, you don't have to look too far to find something you can relate with. Put differently, you have options to pick a niche that you won't have to struggle with. For instance, if creating content is your thing, you can stick to content writing and technical writing, and if coding is not your thing, there is still space for you as there are many tech careers you can go into that don't require coding.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b class="bold_text">Do your research:</b> Everything looks good from afar, and so before you transition into any tech career path, do your research. Check if it's something you can do or might enjoy doing, check if it's a sustainable career path if it has accessible resources and opportunities. This way, you don't get stuck trying to figure out what direction to go.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b class="bold_text">Start with the basics:</b> After doing your research, and choosing a career path, start with the basics. It's tempting to immediately rush your journey and go straight for the big shots, but it is advisable to start with the basics, especially if you have no prior knowledge in that career path. Everything big starts small, so begin with the fundamentals. It's easier to navigate that way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b class="bold_text">Find a mentor/community:</b> The phrase "no man is an island" has never been more accurate. The journey into Tech can be slow and a bit frustrating, but having a community of like-minds or a mentor makes it more accessible. There are so many communities for various tech career paths. Find one and take your place.
                </li>
            <p>
                One of the easiest ways to access Mentorship or a community is to take advantage of tech training opportunities. Some of these opportunities come with Mentorship & internship, while others give access to their communities. Examples of these opportunities are Women Techsters Bootcamp, Ingressive for Good, Digi girls, etc
            </p>
            <p>
                One good thing is that there is an increasing amount of Tech resources online, and so if you are willing to put in the work, it might take some time, but you would eventually strike gold.
