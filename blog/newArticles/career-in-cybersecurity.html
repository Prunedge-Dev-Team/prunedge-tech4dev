                One of the fantastic careers in tech with untapped potential is Cybersecurity, also known as Computer security, or Information Technology Security (IT security). Cybersecurity is the art of protecting data, devices, and organizations from theft or damage. It is also the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond a career path, Cybersecurity has become an essential aspect of our lives, especially as the world is rapidly moving towards a digital age. This is because, as the world advances in digitalization, so do cybercrimes.

            <p>
                Cybercrimes, also known as yahoo-yahoo, are crimes committed online, especially with the aid of the Internet and a device. Examples of cybercrimes are Phishing, Identity theft, Fraud, Corporate Data Breach, and Hacking.
