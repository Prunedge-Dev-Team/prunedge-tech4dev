               October 5th is set aside to mark World Teachers' Day, also known as International Teachers'’ Day. It is an international day held annually and established in 1994 to commemorate the signing of the 1966 UNESCO / ILO Recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers. This standard-setting instrument addresses the status and situations of teachers around the world.
            </p>        
            <p>
                On this day, we celebrate teachers and use this medium to call out for funding for teachers and learning facilities to prioritize education again in our societies gradually. This year's World Teachers Day theme is <i>"Teachers at the heart of education recovery."</i> 
            </p>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 pandemic left such an indelible mark on the educational system around the world. For months, students were out of school and had to pause their learnings. However, this phase brought about new possibilities, such as online classes. Before the pandemic, virtual learning was a thing but, the Coronavirus pandemic popularized it
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, it was hard to adjust to, especially in developing countries, because of various issues like cost of data, internet speed, electricity, unavailability of digital devices for learning, and insufficient knowledge on the usage of digital tools. If anything, this phase exposed the little percentage of students in developing countries that have digital skills, even the most basic of them, and that is why at Tech4Dev, we are constantly striving to bridge this gap.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, regardless of how passionate we are about this mission, we can't equip young people with digital skills all by ourselves, and that's why we celebrate the various facilitators that volunteer with us to make this dream come through. Today being World Teachers Day, we recognize their efforts and the roles they have played in the lives of so many.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are constantly looking for new ways to do new things, and we are hopeful that by World Teachers Day, 2022, we will be closer to our goals than we currently are. 
            </p>
            <p>HAPPY WORLD TEACHERS' DAY</p>
