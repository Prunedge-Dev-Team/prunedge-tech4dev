            Product design isn't just about "pushing pixels" or "making things pop." Product design is about creating usable, functional, and beautiful experiences/products that satisfy user and business needs. - Olamide Jegede, Product Designer

            One of the significant advantages of Tech is its versatility. When people hear Tech, they assume it's all about coding, and it's not so. Tech has so much more to offer than coding. There are various career opportunities in Tech that do not require coding at all, and this versatility is why there are so many career opportunities in Tech. One of these career opportunities is Product Design.

            As a career path, Product design is important because there are always better ways to do things and better products to build, and it is one way to ensure that in the bid to do better, businesses are doing what their consumers need or want to see.
        </p>

            Another importance is that good product design makes the users' experience satisfying. In addition to using a product repeatedly, satisfied customers go ahead to recommend the product often
