               It is no longer news that all over the world, women are side-lined in the tech industry. This is majorly
               because of stereotypes. These stereotypes are birthed and upheld by society and culture. It is even a
               struggle in some underdeveloped countries before young girls and women can get basic education. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But the world is advancing; it is becoming a digital village, and we are rapidly leaving the
                stereotypes behind. Here are some things that can aid making room for women and girls in the
                tech world, especially within organizations.

                    <b class="bold_text">Sensitization:</b> It is essential to sensitize young girls and women on the various opportunities
                    available in tech. It is also necessary to encourage them to study STEM-related courses in
                    schools 
               </li>
               <li>
                    <b class="bold_text">Take initiatives:</b> To mark the 2021 international Women's Day, organizations like Cowrywise,
                    Tech4Dev, Ingressiveforgood came out to offer scholarships/initiatives, job positions, and
                    trust funds for women to encourage women participation in Tech. Initiatives like these go a
                    long way in balancing the apparent gender gap in the tech sector. 
               </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="bold_text"> Equity and fairness:</strong> 72% of women in tech have worked at a company where bro culture is
                    pervasive- Trustradius. "Bro culture" in the workplace is when male employees are seen as
                    superiors to the female employees, which leads to discrimination.  
                    <p>
                       Equity and fairness must be upheld in an organization regardless of gender. Everyone should
                       be given equal benefits, opportunities, and respect in the workplace. Promotions, salary 
                       increases, and other benefits should be based on performance and not gender.

                <li>
                    <b class="bold_text">Ensure the workplace's safety:</b> The number of sexual harassment charges increases by up to
                    15% each year- Source: Dando Diary. To increase the participation of women in tech,
                    organizations must first make the workplace's safety a priority. There should be strict rules
                    and policies in place against sexual harassment. No woman should have to choose between
                    her job and victimization.
