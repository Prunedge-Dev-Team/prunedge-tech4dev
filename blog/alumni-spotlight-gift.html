            Your background? (upbringing, occupation/schooling)
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up in a Godly family. I am the only girl, surrounded by two lovely boys. I engage in male-dominated activities, such as playing football and playing computer games. After my Senior Secondary School, my parents enrolled me for computer training where I learnt Desktop Publishing. After that, I furthered my education at Ebonyi State University Abakaliki, where I obtained a Bachelors Degree of Science in Applied Biology in the year 2016.

            Tell us your Tech4Dev Story: how & when did you get involved, what project?
        </p>
        <p>
            I always had a passion for Tech, but I didn't have the opportunity to obtain a Computer Science certification from my Higher Institution. My drive has always been to provide solutions to real-life problems in my community. So, I started with developing myself, spending at least 2 hours a day coding.  I was finding it difficult to understand some concepts and this made me search for a better approach.  I searched the internet for Bootcamps and Cohorts until I stumbled on the Women Techsters Program and I quickly applied. To my astonishment, I was selected. My cohort started during December 2019 and I was happy to have such an experience in a practical aspect of coding.  I worked with a team of women on a project and we built a website: " Storage Facilities" to enable perishable food items to be well monitored and preserved properly. I also carried out a personal project; I developed a website for teenage girls which will grant them the opportunity to build their careers in the tech sector.

            What were the highlights of your Tech4Dev experience (your training period)?
        </p>
        <p>
            1.	The trainer was down to earth, he devoted his time to answer all my questions when I had difficulty in understanding.
            2.	I built a strong network with women that have goals that aligned with mine.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-heading">
            Volunteerism is a big part of Tech4Devâ€™s program. What are your memories of the trainers or people who delivered the program?
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, I will begin by appreciating Tech4Dev for providing a comfortable environment for learning, in a fully conditioned hall for two weeks.  My Instructor, Mr Emma, was a jovial individual, he provided a variety of resources that still help me till date.

            What opportunities have you gotten related to your training? (internship, programs)
        </p>
        <p>
            I had the opportunity to attend an African Tech Conference "OSCAFEST" which was held in Lagos in March 2020. The event was really mind-blowing.

            What are you doing currently? A brief of your work
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I'm interning at TechSavvy HQ: an organization that is focused on Digital Branding. This has helped to improve my skills and is building me into a better developer.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-heading">
            What are your plans for the future?
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to be a full stack developer, providing technological solutions to problems. I also want to impact young girls by educating them on the importance of the Tech sector (STEM).
        </p>
        <p class="sub-heading">
            How has the program helped you in getting into the role/opportunities you are in?
        </p>
        <p>
            My training at Women Techsters exposed me to the fundamentals of coding and that foundation has given me the opportunity to intern at TechSavvy HQ.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-heading">
            How did the program influence your career path and you in general?
        </p>
        <p>
            It gave me the opportunities to leave my comfort zone which pointed out the right path for me.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-heading">
            What advice would you give to other young women like yourself?
        </p>
        <p>
            Follow your passion, don't let anything hinder you from achieving your set goals.
