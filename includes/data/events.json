        "synopsis": "Every year, the month of May is set aside to create awareness around Mental health. In general terms, mental health is the emotional well-being of an individual. For a very long while, mental health has been viewed as less important than the state of the body, especially in this part of the world. But statistics have shown that the state of one's mental health is, in fact, just as important as the state of the person's body.",
