                                    during the program to build great products driven by AI. The trainers did an excellent job preparing 
                                    us for the world of opportunities.

                                    My name is Ifechi Mafiana and I reside in Abuja. Earlier this year, I came across information about Tech4Dev and the Microsoft Nigeria voucher certification program through a Twitter post. Being a passionate data analyst, I recognized that achieving the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Associate certificate would be a strong way to showcase my recently acquired skills, especially since I had already begun creating models with Power BI.

                                    The driving force behind my journey into the realm of data analysis has been the compelling aspiration to unearth game-changing insights and discern significant trends from data

                                    I come from a family where education wasn't valued, but my mother's love for education inspired me, and I strived to make a difference despite the challenges I faced in school and then unemployment. The experience in the Women Techsters Fellowship has been a steppingstone to my success. I obtained my first global certificate (Certified in Cybersecurity) in October 2022, two months after the training started. Tech4Dev has given me the courage, knowledge, and skills to pass my Certified in Cybersecurity exam, and ace interviews.

                                    Growing up, I noticed a trend of teenage pregnancies in my family and how this trend affected my father’s stance on investing in a girl’s education. Even though he provided me with the best he could, I could feel his fear that I might slip into the trend. This, however, only fueled my determination to stand out.
Right after my first degree, I wanted to pursue an MSc. in Data Science but could not afford it. All the other opportunities I saw were equally expensive. Then I found the Women Techsters Fellowship and the rest is history. The training has prepared me for the world through both hard skills and soft skills. I have been given some knowledge in areas of Data Science that people are paying thousands for. The incorporation of soft skills into the training gives it a 5-star rating.

                                    As a Mass Communication graduate, I’ve always been passionate about tech but didn't consider taking it as a career until after my NYSC with no job, which got me thinking about how to improve myself and my earning power.
The Women Techsters Fellowship training has been instrumental in propelling my career forward. The training has equipped me with invaluable skills and knowledge, enabling me to excel in my career. I kicked off my career with an internship placement by Tech4Dev, and I was retained full-time. During the training, I was able to familiarize myself with Design Thinking, UX Research, Interaction Design, Prototyping, User Experience (UX), Figma, etc. The soft skills training was one of my highlights from the training.
                                   <!-- I found out about the Women Techsters program through my friend who went through the program as well. I didn’t have any idea about programming or building websites before the training. I was able to learn all these within the period of the program; it was fascinating to be able to build a website on my own. -->

                                    For the longest time, one of my goals has been to find a way to merge epidemiology, biostatistics, and computer technologies to solve health problems using data-driven decisions. In exploring various options to do this, I pursued a career in Data Science while sourcing for scholarship and internship opportunities in health data analysis or epidemiology and biostatistics to do my Ph.D.
I applied for the Bootcamp, and then after the duration of the Bootcamp, I applied for the Fellowship because I wanted more in-depth training and because the focus areas and objectives matched my interest. I got admitted to the Data Science learning track after a rigorous screening process. I faced many challenges during the training because my town became a warzone, and my family and I had to move to an IDP camp, and I could only take my phone.

                                    I initially came across the advertisement of the Women Techsters Fellowship on Twitter. At the time, I felt a bit stuck in my quest to advance my tech skills and further my knowledge. With a sense of optimism, I decided to apply and was pleasantly surprised when I received an acceptance. I was genuinely excited, as I had doubts about being accepted given my lack of software development skills.
Participation in the Women Techsters Fellowship program sharpened my hard work, it has opened my eyes beyond South Africa and expanded my technical skills. It created the foundation for me to learn Software Development and I have learned a lot and even created a few landing pages.

                                <p>
                                    In 2020, I decided to transition into tech after being inspired by a design I saw online. I faced several challenges along my tech journey, especially since I started learning on my own. Overcoming these challenges became easier when I joined the Women Techsters Bootcamp and found helpful resources on YouTube.
The Women Techsters Bootcamp training program was both fun and enriching, and it has significantly contributed to my career growth. The training with Tech4Dev helped me understand various design principles that I wouldn’t have known about through self-learning. Among other things, I particularly enjoyed working on personal projects and the group project. It was a truly enjoyable experience.
                                   <!-- The Basic Digital Literacy for Northern Nigeria project was very impactful for me. I participated in the training because I wanted to gain knowledge that would make me digitally literate so as to help me fit into society and also become an entrepreneur with a computer center where I can train people and also earn from it. -->

This training has helped me improve my computer skills and now I can find my way around a computer without stress. I am thankful to Tech4Dev and FCDO for this opportunity to improve on myself and potentially contribute positively to my community. -->

                                I transitioned from Graphics Design to Product Design, which took me a year and included several online courses, and then participating in the Women Techsters Fellowship program. During the Women Techsters Fellowship training, I worked on various projects, including an app for walking that I worked on with my team members. I also created an app that connects vets with animal lovers who would love to adopt pets. Despite my interest in making designs look good, my supervisor helped me understand that the product must be a usable product for the users. Although I had to work on the hardest part of transitioning, making functional products instead of just making designs look good.

                                My first encounter with the Women Techsters program was in 2021 when I applied for the first cohort of the Fellowship but unfortunately, I didn’t get in. I didn’t let this rejection discourage me from the strong desire I had to improve my Frontend skills and learn more about Frontend technologies and so, when the application for the second cohort of the Women Techsters Fellowship opened, I didn’t hesitate to apply and thankfully, I got in.

                                I started my career in technology in 2018. I got into tech because I developed a passion for the Product Design field, especially concerning web 3.0 and Fintech. My tech journey has not been easy, but it has been an exciting journey.
Despite the challenges faced during the fellowship, I have recorded many proud moments in my Women Techsters Fellowship journey. One was being selected as one of the North African Representatives for Women Techsters. As a representative, I had the opportunity to work alongside other leaders in the Fellowship to positively impact the tech industry and help other women during the Fellowship. Another time, I was chosen as a project team leader to guide and assist my team during the learning process.

                                I've always had a passion to fix things. In fact, I once taught myself how to repair a faulty socket—it was quite an interesting experience!  Coming from a legal background, getting into the Women Techsters Fellowship, I made a firm commitment to fully embrace a career in technology. My motivation was fuelled by my insatiable thirst for knowledge and the authentic excitement I experienced whenever I immersed myself in learning. Through the training, I gained a profound understanding of the essence of the phrase "women supporting women." I encountered genuine and unwavering support from individuals who didn't even know my last name. Significantly, I don't believe I can narrate my tech journey without mentioning Tech4Dev. Without participating in this program, I would likely still be hesitating about my transition into the tech field.

                                My name is Toluwanimi Abioye, and I'm currently a student at Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife, majoring in physiotherapy. Alongside my academic pursuits, I have a deep love for product design.  
                                I first learned about Tech4Dev through my brother, who introduced me to the Bootcamps in 2022. That experience was profound and left a lasting impression on me. Inspired by what I learned, I applied for the Women Techsters Fellowship program and was fortunate to be selected. It felt like a dream come true because it was the perfect opportunity for me to dive deeper into tech, especially coming from a background in Physiotherapy.

                                What truly stood out during my time in the program was the sense of community and collaboration. I had the privilege of working alongside talented and passionate individuals from diverse backgrounds. We collaborated on tasks and projects.

                                I am a single parent of two adorable twin girls in Lagos, Nigeria. Currently, I am pursuing my HND in Business Administration and Management at Yabatech, all while exploring the tech space for opportunities to fulfill my dream of becoming a successful businesswoman.
                                Eight years ago, at the age of 17, I became a mother right as I was about to reach the pinnacle of my academic journey. Despite facing societal discrimination due to teenage pregnancy, I exhibited immense resilience and strength to overcome the challenges thrown my way, including battling suicidal thoughts.
                                In my determination to provide for my daughters and prove my critics wrong, I made significant sacrifices, such as putting my education on hold to work and support my family. My dedication and brilliance in my O.N.D. program in Business Administration & Management earned me recommendations for a management job upon completion, which further boosted my income.

                                Coming from a background in Sociology, I embarked on a career in Product Design in 2021 during my final year of studies in the university. Tech allows me to tap into my creative side and think outside the box.  I applied for the Fellowship because I was searching for a well-structured organization where I could learn, grow, and be part of a community of young people who are also on a learning journey. Women Techsters program seemed like an excellent platform to achieve these goals, with the added possibility of securing an internship role after the training.
                                My experience was incredibly positive; I acquired valuable technical skills and improved my soft skills. I had the opportunity to collaborate with participants from different learning tracks, and I gained a deeper understanding of Product Design, which has proven beneficial in my current job as a Product Designer.
