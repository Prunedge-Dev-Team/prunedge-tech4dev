            The Honorable Minister of Youth and Sport for the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Honorable Sunday Dare recently paid a courtesy visit to one of the ATC Digital Village centers in Agege, Lagos State.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Digital Village is an American Tower Corporation (ATC) project under the management of Tech4Dev. The DVs are converted container boxes located within ATC Nigeriaâ€™s sites across 36 states in Nigeria. The boxes accommodate 12 computers and equipment for learning digital skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            These facilities are located in local communities across Nigeria and provide community members with free digital skills training towards decent work and entrepreneurship.
        </p>
        <p>
            On 10th January 2020, Tech4Dev hosted the honorable minister at the DV at Agege where he inspected the site, commended the innovation involved in the project and validated that the initiative will indeed give underserved youths access to 21st-century skills. We were glad to have the honourable minster around and we are looking forward to the possibility of partnering with the Ministry of Youth and Sport on this wonderful initiative.
        </p>
