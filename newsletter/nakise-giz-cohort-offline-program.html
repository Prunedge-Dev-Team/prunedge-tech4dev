            The NAKISE program is an initiative that is built to foster employability, entrepreneurship, and enable workplace efficiency. The NAKISE offline program organized in partnership with organizations trains youths on essential career skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            The NAKISE Cohort 2 & 3 offline program was delivered in partnership with Nigerian-German center for Jobs, Migration, and Re-integration. The 2nd training started on 8th July 2019 and the 3rd cohort 22nd July 2019, each running for five working days at the GIZ Center.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were 50 participants in each cohort, who were trained on topics ranging from Work readiness, Office Utility tools, Career readiness, to Design thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            The participants of the training were able to demonstrate what they learned in this period by building a business proposal and writing an action plan for their career path. They also showed their presentation skills, use of excel, and basic digital marketing tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            We sincerely appreciate Nigerian-German center for jobs, migration, and re-integration for powering the NAKISE offline class and all our facilitators for taking out time to train the participants.
