            We have had another record breakthrough as 23 youths graduated from the digital skills training in Argungu, Kebbi State. The ATC Digital Village is an American Tower Corporation project managed by Tech4Dev intending to provide youth and students in rural communities access to digital skills with the aim of exposing them to 21st century skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            In November 2019, the Digital Village center in Kebbi commenced a digital skills training for indigenes that took them through introduction to computing, basic use of productivity tools and designing. At the end of the three months training, the participants were certified after going through a series of projects to ascertain their skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            In attendance at the graduation ceremony were representatives of HRH. Alhaji Ismaila Mohammed Mera (Emir of Argungu) and His Excellency, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, the Executive Governor of Kebbi state. After the event, we paid a courtesy visit to the Emir’s palace where the Emir expressed his gratitude towards the project and he acknowledged the empowerment the project was giving to the people of the community.

            The participants also shared their excitement on the initiative, one of the youths – Abubakar shared his story with us. “Before this training, I had no idea what a mouse was for or  what it looked like. Now, I am a certified computer literate person; I have expertise and can achieve tasks such as typing and using Microsoft Office suite on a computer”.
