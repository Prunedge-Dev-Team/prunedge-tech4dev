            Kano state took part in the experiential learning program of the Nigerian Women Techsters starting from 4th May 2019 to 6th July 2019. The Demo day/closing ceremony held at the Startup Kano Hub on 13th July 2019 with 90 women graduating from the program.
        </p>
        <p>
            The beneficiaries were trained in two tracks: Web and Mobile Development and Embedded systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Web and Mobile development track developed and presented three projects, which are:
        </p>
        <ul class="article__list">
            <li>
                An automated calculator that generates monthly spend in comparison to income, this digital calculator monitors income input and expenditure and then gives a balance by the end of a period
            </li>
            <li>
                A social enterprise platform for SMEs to subscribe and access essential digital tools for marketing (organization branding, digital marketing, website optimization)
            </li>
            <li>
                The third project is an online platform that helps widows and orphans access funds for their basic survival needs. It is an open platform that allows donors to sponsor individuals subscribed to the platform
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Embedded systems track had projects on a wireless sensory device to detect fire outbreak, once this device detects smoke or fire in a particular building it signals the fire service unit on the specific house where the outbreak is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another project is a sensory bulb device that detects body temperature and comes on when someone is in the room and then goes off when the individual is out; this also gives a signal to the owner of the room when an intruder walks in. It is user-friendly and simple; you get notified via your mobile device.
        </p>
        <p>
            The excitement in the air was contagious as the beneficiaries were eager and to share their experiences, one of the women, Aishat, expressed her excitement and appreciation to the facilitators and organizers for bringing such an initiative to Kano state and empowering women on digital skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Judges and facilitators present were the team from Startup Kano: Mustapha Muhammad Garba, Aisha Abdulhammeed, Khausar Muhammad Rabi’u and Mr. Ahmed Bature (Cofounder, Startup Kano).
        </p>
        <p>
            We extend our heartfelt appreciation to Startup Kano for the contributions towards making this training program a success.
