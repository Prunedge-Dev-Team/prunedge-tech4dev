            With our continued resolve to bridge the gap of gender equality in the technology ecosystem, our partnership with The Nigerian-German Centre for Jobs, Migration, and Reintegration has birthed the 4th cohort of the Women Techsters training.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this cohort, 23 women have undergone an intensive training program on Web Development; they learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

            I was a participant in the WT program; it has sincerely been an enjoyable experience. On my first day here, I was very pensive because I had no idea about programming or coding, coming here as changed everything, my tutors and everybody were willing to help. It was also interesting meeting women from diverse understanding and backgrounds; we all came together to learn a new skill. I learned a lot, and I attribute all these to the Tech4Dev WT program. – Minam Nwabuaso, one of the beneficiaries, shares her experience with us.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are all excited about the evident impact on these women's lives.
        </p>
