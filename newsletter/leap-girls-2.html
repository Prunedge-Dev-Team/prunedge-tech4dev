            The Women Techsters program has had another success as two of our beneficiaries got into the 2nd cohort of the Microsoft Leap Engineering program.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ifeoma Sandra and Ndutimobong Enang were beneficiaries of the Women Techsters- GIZ program in Lagos, where they got solid base knowledge on programming and web development. Prior to this program, they had no knowledge on programming, they were trained and thereafter got the opportunity to apply to the Leap Hackathon program.
        </p>
        <p>
            Excitedly, Ifeoma and Ndu got into the program alongside 6 other women giving Women Techsters a 25% participation in the 2nd cohort of the Leap Hackathon.
        </p>
        <p>
            “The WT program gave me a rich background to thrive in technology, I may not have gotten the Leap program without the learnings and mentorship from the program” says Ifeoma. Ndu also shared her excitement saying “I remain grateful to Women Techsters for this great priviledge, my life is completely changed because of this.”
        </p>
        <p>
            We are excited for these two champions, and we see many more women getting into tech positions just like them.
        </p>
