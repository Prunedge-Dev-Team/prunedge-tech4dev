            “I joined the NWT program because I was interested in acquiring skills in tech. I have been following the initiative since inception, and I was elated when I got to know about the Lagos program. Joining as really been amazing, educative, and intensive. I got to learn a lot about web development; it was really beyond my expectations. After now, I hope to improve my skills; I want to build business solutions in line with climate issues in Nigeria.” – Rita Chukwuneye, NWTLagos Beneficiary

            The Nigerian Women Techsters initiative, with the goal of training 2,400 women across 12 states in Nigeria, is rounding up with the Lagos cohort. The program will introduce learners to digital and analytical skills to kick start a career in tech.

            Selected participants attended the two weeks’ program on Web Development, where they were trained on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They were trained practically, with the frequent assessment to keep them on track.
