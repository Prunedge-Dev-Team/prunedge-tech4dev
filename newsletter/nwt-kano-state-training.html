                On 4th May 2019, the NWT training started in Kano state with 96 women in attendance on the first day of training. The women were introduced to the relevance of acquiring tech skills and opportunities within the tech space in the 21st century. They were also introduced to the 17 sustainable development goals and a clear connection to the relevance of the program.

                Present at the opening were facilitators from startup Kano, volunteersâ€™ trainers from NWT, and experienced leaders in tech.
