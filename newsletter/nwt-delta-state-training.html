                The Nigerian Women Techsters started its 3rd cohort in Warri, Delta state. On 20th March 2019, The training is divided into three primary tracks: web and mobile development, games development, and embedded systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the first day, we had an attendance of over 65 women who were screened rigorously and had shown commitment to learning and giving their time to schooling themselves in the choice programming tracks. The beneficiaries were eager to learn as they were able to create webpages on the first day of training.
            </p>
            <p>
                Participants were given learning materials to aid their pace of learning. The Warri training is designed in a two weeks boot camp style, where the women will be trained intensively and after that present their projects on the DEMO DAY.
            </p>
            <p>
                The delta state-NWT training is in partnership with Terchub.
