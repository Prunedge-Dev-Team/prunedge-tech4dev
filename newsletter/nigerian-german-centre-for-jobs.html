                Tech4Dev has successfully graduated another set of Women Techsters powered by Nigerian-German Centre for Jobs, Migration, and Re-integration (GIZ). The Women Techsters program is a two-week boot camp coding training that covers Web and Mobile development, Games development and Embedded systems.

            <p>
                This training gives beneficiaries, a base knowledge on digital skills and bridges the digital gap between men and women in Africa. The training also aims to empower women to build a career in technology, study STEM courses, run their own tech business, and manage technology-leveraged enterprises.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second cohort ran from March 15 through March 28, 2019, with 22 women from across Lagos taking part in the Web and Mobile development track. At the end of the training, the beneficiaries presented their projects in line with at least one of the SDGs goals. The judges: Enoch Afolabi (Business Development Manager, Iqube-labs), Celestine Ezeokoye (CEO, WeMoveCo.) Chimaka Obitube (Community Manager, Findworka) and Moyin Joseph (MRC) were impressed with the project presented and quality of knowledge acquired within the space of two weeks. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The two weeks of training will be followed up with eight weeksâ€™ internship placement with reputable tech organizations. We are grateful to our volunteer facilitators, judges, and panelists. We also appreciate GIZ for powering the training. Outstanding participants will be provided with mentorship and internship opportunities, thereby ensuring long-term sustained impact for all beneficiaries.
