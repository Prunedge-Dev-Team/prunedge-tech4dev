            We just concluded 4th Nakise offline cohort in partnership with Nigerian-German for Jobs, Migration and re-integration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Austine Onoja, one of our participants, is a recent graduate who is enthusiastic and eager to start up a career in engineering. Austine joined the program with little knowledge on using work tools for business and workplace efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the class, he expressed his excitement and admiration at the properly composed curriculum and how the trainers took time to teach and explain topics duly. He said; “I have been to so many training, this is exceptional as I have gotten a lot that will help my career.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Austine and 24 others have been trained on career and entrepreneurship skills; they all jointly agree that the Nakise program has elevated them to be rightly positioned for growth and expertise in their various careers.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the training program, all the participants were able to demonstrate what they’ve learned by building a business proposal and writing an action plan for their career path. They also showed their presentation skills, use of excel, and basic digital marketing tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            The NAKISE program is an initiative that is built to foster employability, entrepreneurship, and enable workplace efficiency; the 4th offline cohort ran for five days from 5th August through 9th August 2019 at the GIZ center.
