            Tech4Dev representatives joined an introductory meeting held in the Makoko community at the Digital Village Center on 18th February 2020. The purpose of the meeting was for key community members to become better acquainted with Tech4Dev and its role within the Digital Village project.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were 19 people present, consisting of Church leaders, members, the Branch Secretary of Red Cross, Makoko and the respected community leader. The meeting allowed Tech4Dev to introduce the Digital Village project and questions concerning the Digital Village Project were answered. The meeting proved successful as the Makoko community leaders pledged their support to the success of the program while in agreement with Tech4Dev and our incidence in the Digital Village project.

            At the Digital Village center, we already have students from the local community school who were been introduced to basic digital skills and use of computers.
