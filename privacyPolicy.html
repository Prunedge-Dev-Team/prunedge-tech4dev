              You have the right to:
            </p>  
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Request  access  to  your  personal  data  (commonly  known  as  a  “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to checkthat we are lawfully processing it.
               </li>
                <li>
                   Request  correction  of  the  personal  data  that  we  hold  about  you.  This enables  you  to  have  any  incomplete  or  inaccurate  data  we  hold  about  you corrected,  though  we  may  need  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  new  data  you provide to us.               
                </li>
                <li>
                   Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.                
                </li>
                <li>
                   Object  to  processing  of  your  personal  data  where  we  are  relying  on  a legitimate  interest  (or  those  of  a  third  party)  and  there  is  something  about  your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.  In  some  cases,  we  may  demonstrate  that  we  have  compelling legitimate  grounds  to  process  your  information  which  override  your  rights  and freedoms.                
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.                
                </li>
                <li>
                    You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
                </li>
                <ul> 
                    Request the transfer of your personaldata to you or to a third party. We will provide  to  you,  or  a  third  party  you  have  chosen,  your  personal  data  in  a structured,  commonly  used,  machine-readable  format.  Note  that  this  right  only applies  to  automated  information  which  you  initially  provided consent  for  us  to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
