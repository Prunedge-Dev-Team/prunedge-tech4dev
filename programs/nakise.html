                                The week’s training has been enlightening, I have done ICT training before, and it was not like this. It was just the basic, and it was an eye-opener for me. I enjoyed the classes. The tutors were patient and explained well. We did a PowerPoint presentation, and I perfected my presentation skills within the training period. I want to say thank you to Tech4Dev, and I appreciate the opportunity.

                                It’s a very enlightening program; they taught us about office software, PowerPoint, Excel, and others how to use slides and organize them for a presentation. They taught us how to behave in a corporate environment, organizational skills. I’ll encourage other people to participate because it’s fun and highly useful.
