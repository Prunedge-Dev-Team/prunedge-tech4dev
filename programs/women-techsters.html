                    The Women Techsters program is an offshoot of the Nigerian Women Techsters (NWT). The program will train 5,000,000 women across Africa by 2030.
                </p>  
                <p>
                    After the success of the NWT and Code4Impact project, Women Techsters Africa will commence its goal to train 5 million women to code across African countries. We are developing an army of smart women coders across Africa who will build technology start-ups and technology-enabled businesses that will promote the economic development of the African continent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The WT project will partner with corporate organizations, foundations, government, and funders to train women in underserved communities across Africa. Currently, we are running the pilot cohort with the Nigerian-German Centre for Jobs, Migration, and Re-integration in Lagos, Nigeria. We have trained over 50 women for the pilot cohorts.

                                I got to know about the NWT program through my friend, who went through the program. I didnâ€™t have any idea about programming or building websites before the training. I was able to learn all these within the period of the program; it was fascinating to be able to build a website on my own.
                                I got on an internship with TechSavvy, an opportunity provided by Tech4Dev to help improve my skills. The most exciting part of my experience is that I got a chance to be a part of the Microsoft Leap Engineering Program.
                                I cannot tell my story without Women Techsters. It was through the program, I got my Internship opportunity and into the Microsoft Program.

                                I initially thought tech was for majorly men, engineers, and computer scientists; it was during my training with WT that I changed that mindset.
                                I learned a lot during the training; I especially thank my tutors; they did a lot. From this training, I recently got an opportunity to be among the 1st cohort of the Microsoft Leap Apprenticeship program, and I see myself taking leaps from there.

                                I heard about WT via social media, I was invited for an interview, and I was elated to have gotten in. I was delighted when I got into the facility provided; we had enough laptops, the trainers were enough, they were patient and answered our questions satisfactorily. I want to appreciate the organizers of this program; now I know how to use CSS, HTML, and bootstrap. With this training, I have been able to build my blog.

                                It was from the career path at GIZ that I got into the program; the two weeks boot camp has helped me decide on which area to further in my career.

                                It was quite encouraging and helpful. I was able to continue my learning online, and I also got materials from our trainer. Currently, I am an assistant trainer with Women Techsters; I didn't expect to be here.

                                I'm especially grateful to Tech4Dev, they trained me and have also provided me a job.

It was awesome; the tutors were willing to help and explain everything to us. I am now able to build a website and write codes, so excited. Thanks to Tech4Dev.
