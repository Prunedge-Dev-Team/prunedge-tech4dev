                    The Nigerian Women Techsters bridges the digital knowledge divide between men and women by training 2,400 women in underserved communities across Nigeria, resulting in increased access to more coding talent, capable of improving quality of work within organizations and eventually, promoting economic growth and development in Nigeria and across the African continent.
                </p>  
                <p>
                    NWT will train 2,400 young women between the ages of 18 – 40 across Nigeria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The initiative is being delivered through intensive training by experienced facilitators, and it focuses on three significant tracks, namely:

                                Here is my feedback on the fantastic learning experience I got at the Nigerian Women Techsters program.
                                My experience was incredible; being a novice coming in to learn how to code, I was able to comprehend all the lessons and apply them to create projects.
                                The training was interactive, and the tutors were ready to train and pour they're all.
                                It was life-changing.
                                Thank you for the opportunity.
                            </p>

                                I stumbled on the flyer online, and I was surprised when I was selected to go through the training. I have always wanted to learn to program; Thankfully NWT came up, and it was terrific, I learned a lot, the classes were explanatory, and I have been able to do some projects all by myself. I’m very grateful for this training. It has changed my life.

                                It was an excellent opportunity for me, and I was able to gain knowledge while also training others. This process gave leverage to apply for job openings, and I'm currently at a well-paying job because of my experiences at Tech4dev.
