                    The Basic Digital Education Initiative is an experiential learning computer education and STEM program that aims to train 500,000 public school students between ages 8 -18 across selected states in Nigeria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of the project is to introduce learners in underserved communities to the world of digital literacy and equip them with the basic digital knowledge that is required to succeed in the 21st century world and workplace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Basic Digital Education Initiative aligns with sustainable development goal 4 & 10 (Quality Education & Reduced Inequalities). By investing in quality education for children in underserved communities, this would help reduce inequalities among students in public schools and private schools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The training will cover critical areas like Introduction to computing, productivity tools, basic web skills, workplace essentials, big data, cloud technologies and cyber security.
